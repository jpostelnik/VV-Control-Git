This is a short had from of our repo for Vicotrain Voltage's control systems show off. In this repo you will find our main movment, PID, Kalman Filter and much more. As this is a shorteneded forum of our git hub a lot of smaller methods have been removed from here to keep it clean. For full explantion of the code read through the Control Award Application document and look at the rest of code: https://github.com/jpostelnik/VictorianVoltagUltamiteGoal
